# DYMUN-BOT
Crisis committee in MUN is super thrilling. However, the process of handling directives is extremely manual and time-consuming, more often than not lead to foreseeable problems. This bot helps automate the task and more than that! I uploaded the basic one and the one I made exclusively for UNSC at DYMUN'24.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bot is Discord-based. Please watch the video on how to create a Discord bot using Python on Youtube by FreeCodeCamp. The python codes (in the master branch) only account for the source code.
Crisis Directors only need to process in the main channels with 3 buttons. It is unlimited, really.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic one is almost ready with a few steps. You just need to turn on Developer mode and then copy all the required channel IDs and it is ready to deploy.
The second one (which aids a real mechanism used at DYMUN'24) set up a set of countries (delegates). Each country has certain properties. The code allows each country to see its data with /info and in later game, /country. The CDs can then accept/refuse the directives and use the commands that only they know to modify each country's data.

Feel free to modify the code!
